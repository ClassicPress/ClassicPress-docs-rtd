# ClassicPress-docs-rtd

Trial of using reStatedText + readthedocs.io for ClassicPress documentation.

We decided to use a ClassicPress site instead of this approach.  Current repositories at the time of this writing:

- Site: https://github.com/ClassicPress/site-docs
- Content (Markdown files): https://github.com/ClassicPress/ClassicPress-docs
